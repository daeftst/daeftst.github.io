I am a first-year PhD student in Statistics at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research motivation is to make large-scale machine learning systems more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy, ideally in a principled manner.

I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/). Most recently, I worked as a machine learning research intern at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com) and as a software engineering intern at [Tacto](https://tacto.ai). Previously, I interned at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) with [Geoff Pleiss](https://geoffpleiss.com) on theoretical properties of ensembles, and at the [Helmholtz AI Institute](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) with [Niki Kilbertus](https://sites.google.com/view/nikikilbertus/home) and [Elisabeth Ailer](https://elisabethailer.com) on estimating nonlinear causal effects in confounded environments. I also co-founded [Mathis](https://www.abimitmathis.de), an AI tutor for German high school students.

During my undergraduate degree, I was supported by the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/) and am an [Atlas Fellow](https://atlasfellowship.org/) (2022) and winner of the [National Student Championships in Computer Science](https://bwinf.de/) (Germany, 2020). In my free time, I enjoy [writing](https://substack.com/@niclasdern), reading, swimming, traveling, and meeting new people.
