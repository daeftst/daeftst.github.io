I am a 3rd-year mathematics undergraduate student at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), currently visiting [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) supported by the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/). My research motivation is to make large-scale machine learning systems more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy, ideally in a principled manner.

In the past, I've interned at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where I worked with [Geoff Pleiss](https://geoffpleiss.com) on theoretical properties of ensembles, and worked at the [Helmholtz AI Institute](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) with [Niki Kilbertus](https://sites.google.com/view/nikikilbertus/home) and [Elisabeth Ailer](https://elisabethailer.com) on estimating nonlinear causal effects in confounded environments. As I have a passion for EdTech, I also co-founded [Mathis](https://www.abimitmathis.de), an AI tutor that provides individualized feedback for math exams to German high school students.

I am an [Atlas Fellow](https://atlasfellowship.org/) (2022) and a winner of the [National Student Championships in Computer Science](https://bwinf.de/) (Germany, 2020). In my free time, I enjoy reading, swimming, traveling, and meeting new people.
