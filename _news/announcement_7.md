**New preprint online:** [Energy-Weighted Flow Matching: Unlocking Continuous Normalizing Flows for Efficient and Scalable Boltzmann Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03726). We introduce a novel training objective enabling continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy function evaluations.
